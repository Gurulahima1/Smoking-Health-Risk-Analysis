# Smoking-Health-Risk-Analysis
Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that provides a structured and data driven analysis of healthcare operations. The project supports decision making by highlighting trends, performance metrics, and clinical insights through interactive visualizations.

The uploaded .pbix file includes all datasets, modelling processes, and report pages.

# Project Objectives

Analyse patient volume, clinical outcomes, resource utilisation, and performance trends.

Present insights through intuitive, interactive dashboards.

Support strategic healthcare decisions using data driven evidence.

Demonstrate professional Power BI report development techniques.

# Features

Data cleaning and transformation with Power Query.

Relational modelling for accurate measures and calculations.

KPI indicators, trend charts, tables, and segmentation views.

Clean, intuitive layout designed for business users.

# Key Insights
Patient Volume and Demographics

The dataset shows observable fluctuations in patient arrivals influenced by demographic patterns and potential seasonal factors.

Certain age brackets appear more frequently, indicating targeted service demand.

# Treatment Outcomes

Some departments record strong recovery rates while others lag, showing inconsistencies in treatment effectiveness.

Readmission patterns reveal potential weaknesses in post discharge monitoring.

Resource Utilisation

Occupancy varies significantly between departments, indicating possible overuse in some areas and underutilisation in others.

Staff resources may not be aligned with actual service demand patterns.

Financial or Cost Observations

Cost efficiency is not uniform across service lines, signalling areas where operational improvements can be implemented.

# Identified Problems

Patient load imbalance creating operational pressure on high demand units.

Variable recovery outcomes across departments.

Inefficient staff and resource allocation.

Indications of weak follow up processes due to recurring readmissions.

# Recommendations

Align staff and resources with real time demand patterns.

Standardise clinical workflows to improve treatment consistency.

Implement structured follow up procedures to reduce readmissions.

Conduct focused departmental reviews to uncover root causes of weak outcomes.

Strengthen data collection quality to support more accurate forecasting and analysis.
